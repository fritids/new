						Students living in the New York Tri-State area, London, Buenos Aires, Rio, and South Florida can access in-person private and group tutoring. For students outside those areas, we offer high-tech video tutoring as well as travel tutoring through our Global Elite program. All tutoring packages are customized based on the score improvement a student needs to achieve his goal scores.<br/><br />

					The SAT/ACT Edge&#0153; is our suite of materials including our 560-page book, our innovative online course, and our newly launched iPhone app. All of them capitalize on the similarities between the SAT and ACT and provide students the most efficient path towards major score improvement. The guide is a 560-page book that integrates with the online course to offer students techniques and video lessons for ALL topics on the SAT and ACT. The online course has over 1000 questions, each with its own video explanation to give students extensive practice. The app is an unofficial index for both the College Board's Official SAT Study Guide and The Real ACT Prep Guide, and sorts all of the questions in each book by question type for targeted practice. And unlike other companies who create their own tests, we only use real exams to guarantee legitimate scores.

						We work directly with schools to provide SAT/ACT Edge subscriptions for their students at considerable discounts off our retail prices. We also offer Professional Development workshops to train teachers to incorporate the SAT/ACT Edge into the school's Math & English curriculum. Lastly, we coordinate SAT/ACT Bootcamps during the summer months and school breaks and can also customize ongoing courses during the school year. We also work with tutors and smaller tutoring companies to provide them with materials, discounted access to our online SAT/ACT prep course, and training programs. We are happy to say we've never turned a student away who cannot pay for our classes and not only provide extensive scholarships, but also offer complimentary materials and online course access to non-profits, Title I schools, and students qualifying for the Reduced Lunch program.
